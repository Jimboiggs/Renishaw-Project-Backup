As a group, we developed the game 'Pong' in Python, utilising a client-server network. The server handles the main processing of the game such as collisions and scoring. Each client on the network is a player. Clients take inputs from each player and sends this to the server via a switch. Server then processes and relays the coordinates of each game object to each client so the game can be displayed.

We presented our game at the end of the week to industry experts, collegues and our mentors. This included a demonstration of our game, as well as an overview of why we chose this project, the design of our system and how it could be improved over a longer time frame. We used the AGILE technique to ensure we completed the project and presentation on time.

The biggest thing this project has taught me is using GitHub to manage source control within a group. We utilised branches, pull requests and code reviews. This ensured that we could work on code simultaneously within a large group and ensure our code was of a high quality. This was also the first time I have implemented online multiplayer in a game.

My mentor stated:
"James arrived with enthusiasm every day, communicated well, and played a big role in leading the team. He worked efficiently on the initial prototype for the game, and made a large contribution to the group presentation."
